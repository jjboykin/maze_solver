# maze_solver

**Ideas for extending the project**
1.  Add other solving algorithms, like breadth-first search or A*
2.  Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
3.  Mess with the animation settings:
    - ~~Make it faster/slower.~~ 
    - Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
4.  Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
5.  Make much larger mazes to solve
6.  Make it a game where the user chooses directions
    - If you made it a game, allow the user to race an algorithm
7.  Make it 3 dimensional
8.  Time the various algorithms and see which ones are the fastest
9.  Implement logging
10. ~~Implement type annotations~~
11. Implement docstrings
12. ~~Implement dataclasses~~
